1. Confirm Environment Variables and Project Config
1.1. Verify Supabase Credentials
• Check that SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are set in your environment.
• Reasoning: Missing credentials or incorrect environment variable values will prevent database connections in your functions.
1.2. Review OpenAI API Key
• Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set, since you use it for embeddings and chat.
• Reasoning: Without this, your AI features (summaries, categorization) won’t function.
1.3. LangSmith Tracing Setup
• Confirm LANGSMITH_API_KEY and LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 are set to the required values.
• Reasoning: The withLangSmithTracing/helper code depends on these values to capture logs and post them to the LangSmith platform.
1.4. Yarn Script for Supabase
• Make sure you’re running “yarn supabase” commands (not npm).
• Reasoning: The environment is already configured for Yarn, and mixing package managers can cause dependency conflicts.

2. Validate Database Schema and Tables
2.1. Confirm Table Existence
• Ensure all referenced tables (tickets, ticket_comments, knowledge_base, ai_logs, etc.) exist in your database.
• Reasoning: Attempting to query non-existent tables yields errors when you deploy or invoke your functions.
2.2. Verify RPC Functions
• Confirm custom RPC functions (e.g., match_tickets, match_messages, create_invite) are present and tested in your Supabase project.
• Reasoning: The code references these functions, so you must have them deployed in your database or the function calls will fail.
2.3. Check for Additional Indexes or Constraints
• For performance or uniqueness requirements, review if additional indexes or constraints are needed (especially for searching tickets or matching knowledge base documents).
• Reasoning: Proper indexing can drastically improve read performance, particularly when you’re dealing with similarity searches.

3. Deployment Checklist for Each Supabase Function
3.1. adminAgent Function
• Includes the agentOrchestrator logic for conversing with the user and calling tools.
• Ensure that handleAdminAgentRequest is properly imported and that your POST request payload has messages and newUserMessage.
• Reasoning: This ensures the function receives necessary data to pass to the agent.
3.2. handle-invite Function
• Verifies Authorization header, checks JWT validity, and triggers an RPC create_invite.
• Ensure your environment variables for supabaseUrl and supabaseServiceKey are valid.
• Reasoning: The invite process is protected; the user must have admin role to call create_invite successfully.
3.3. processEmbeddingQueue
• Loops through message_embedding_queue to generate embeddings and store them.
• Confirm the message_embedding_queue table exists and has the correct schema.
• Reasoning: The function updates the queue status from “pending” → “processing” → “completed” or “failed.” If the table or columns mismatch, you’ll get runtime errors.
3.4. updateEmbeddings Function
• Triggers updates on the “tickets” table embedding column whenever a relevant row changes.
• Make sure your logic checks if subject/description changed before embedding update.
• Reasoning: Minimizes unnecessary embedding calls and keeps embeddings consistent with the latest ticket content.
3.5. update-user-role Function
• Receives userId and role to update the user’s role.
• Double-check that the role you set is valid (admin or agent).
• Reasoning: Mismatched or non-existent roles can break your permission logic.

4. AI Tools and Utility Functions
4.1. Tools Registration in agentOrchestrator
• Each function (e.g., getUnassignedTickets, summarizeTickets, categorizeTicket, updateTicket) is exposed as a tool.
• Validate that you’ve imported them correctly and that their .call or .invoke usage matches your agent.
• Reasoning: The agent uses these tools dynamically; a missing or misnamed import can fail at runtime.
4.2. Document Storage and Embeddings
• documentStore, vectorStore: ensure correct references to SupabaseVectorStore and the right tables (knowledge_base vs. tickets).
• Reasoning: Mismatched table names or forgetting to create the knowledge_base table in Supabase can lead to errors.
4.3. withAiLogging Decorators
• Confirm usage in relevant areas (e.g., withAiLogging for processEmbeddingQueue).
• Reasoning: This captures performance metrics and logs success/error states to your ai_logs table.
4.4. Proper Chat Model Reference
• chatModel from shared/models.ts uses GPT-based calls with optional tracing (callbacks: [tracer]).
• Reasoning: If you forget to pass the correct model or omit the callback array, your logs might not show up in LangSmith.
---
5. Testing and Verification
5.1. Local Dry Run (If Applicable)
• Use “yarn supabase serve” or your local dev approach to test each function.
• Reasoning: Quickly catches environment variable or import path mistakes before shipping.
5.2. Deploy to Supabase Edge
• yarn supabase deploy your-function-name for each function.
• Reasoning: Ensures your latest changes are active in the Supabase environment.
5.3. Inspect Logs in LangSmith
• After you call your agent or any function with the withLangSmithTracing, check logs at the LangSmith dashboard.
• Reasoning: Verifies end-to-end that your logs are posted and the environment variables for tracing are correct.
5.4. Validate AI Behavior with Sample Queries
• Check that the agent can handle queries like “Show me unassigned tickets.”
• Confirm that it outputs partial steps, requests confirmation, and updates tickets if you confirm.
• Reasoning: Ensures features like multi-step conversation, tool calls, and user confirmation flows are working.
---
6. Post-Deployment Maintenance
6.1. Monitor Errors & Rejections
• Keep an eye on your ai_logs and LangSmith logs for new or unhandled errors.
• Reasoning: Rapid iteration allows you to fix issues (e.g., malformed input or database schema changes) before they compound.
6.2. Manage Data Growth
• If your table storing logs or embeddings grows quickly, consider archiving old records or adding database partitioning.
• Reasoning: Vector searches and logging can lead to large data volumes, impacting performance over time.
6.3. Security & Access Control
• Periodically rotate keys (Supabase Service Role Key, etc.) to maintain security best practices.
• Reasoning: Minimizes risk exposure if any key is compromised.

This checklist helps you systematically confirm that every piece of your AI-driven ticketing system— from environment variables to database tables to agent tool usage— is configured correctly and logging properly. By walking through these steps, you’ll reduce the likelihood of deployment surprises and ensure a smoother user experience.
