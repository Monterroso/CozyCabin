Let me walk you through each step of integrating a third-party OAuth provider (like Google or GitHub) into your Supabase-powered authentication system, in a similar style you might get from a tech-savvy colleague. I'll throw in some technical examples along the way to illustrate how things fit together:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: ENABLE THE PROVIDER IN SUPABASE
What You Do:
Open your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication → Providers.
Flip the toggle for the providers you want, then set up the client ID, client secret, and authorized redirect URIs.
Make sure your callback URL (something like https://mydomain.com/auth/callback) precisely matches what you register in the provider’s settings.
Purpose/Result:
Supabase is now aware it can accept logins from that provider.
Without this, if you tried to sign in via Google, it would fail immediately because Supabase wouldn’t recognize the provider.
Testing Approach:
Start local development (for instance, “yarn dev”) and attempt the sign-in flow.
If the provider’s site complains about an “invalid redirect URI” or “mismatched domain,” you likely typed something off in the callback URL.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
In the Supabase dashboard, you’ll see the provider enabled with no error message.
If you attempt a test sign-in, you’re sent to the actual provider login page.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: EXTEND YOUR AUTH STORE OR HOOK
What You Do:
In your auth store file (maybe something like “src/stores/authStore.ts”), add a method such as loginWithProvider(provider: string).
Use the supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth call (in Supabase v2) or an older signIn method in v1, but pass the provider name and options including redirectTo.
Example (Pseudo-Typescript, no markdown):
function loginWithProvider(provider: string) {
try {
setState({ isLoading: true, error: null });
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
provider: provider,
options: {
redirectTo: window.location.origin + "/auth/callback"
}
});
if (error) throw error;
} catch (err) {
setState({ error: err.message || "Failed to login", isLoading: false });
}
}
Purpose/Result:
This gives you a single, central place in your system to initiate OAuth sign-ins.
After you call loginWithProvider("google"), the user is bounced to Google’s OAuth consent screen.
Testing Approach:
Trigger this store method from a button click on the front end.
Check your browser dev tools or logs to see if it successfully opens the provider’s login window.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
One function handles all providers. You can pass “google,” “github,” or any other supported provider. Fewer lines of code, easier maintenance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: UPDATE THE CALLBACK PAGE
What You Do:
In your callback page (maybe “src/pages/auth/CallbackPage.tsx”), handle the scenario where Supabase automatically finalizes the session for OAuth.
If you used email confirmations before (like sign-in links), you might be exchanging codes. Make sure that logic coexists safely with OAuth-based logins.
Usually, after a successful third-party login, the user already has a valid Supabase session as soon as they land on /auth/callback.
Purpose/Result:
Consolidates all sign-in finalization logic in one place so that the user arrives at your callback route, the session is established, and you can redirect them to your main app or dashboard.
Testing Approach:
Open an incognito browser so you’re not already logged in.
Go to your sign-in page, pick “Sign in with Google,” wait for the round trip, then see if you end up on a new page with a valid user session.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
The callback page might just say “Verifying… please wait” briefly, then forward you on if everything’s good. If there’s a failure, maybe it shows an error toast or message.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 4: PROVIDE OAUTH BUTTONS IN THE UI
What You Do:
In your main Login or Signup component, offer branded buttons (for instance, “Sign in with Google,” “Sign in with GitHub”).
On click, call your newly created loginWithProvider("google") function.
Purpose/Result:
Users see a straightforward way to log in using their favorite provider, rather than typing login credentials manually.
Testing Approach:
Click each button to ensure it sends you to the correct third-party OAuth page.
If you created a button for GitHub but see a Google sign-in screen, you likely mixed up the provider value.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
Crisp, labeled buttons for each provider.
A single function call initiates the entire flow, and if the user cancels halfway, your app gracefully handles the error scenario.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 5: PROFILE CREATION & RLS
What You Do:
If your database design has a “profiles” table besides the default Supabase “users,” ensure that new OAuth sign-ins also trigger profile creation.
Often, you can rely on a Supabase trigger that inserts a profile row whenever a new “users” entry appears. Or your onAuthStateChange callback might do it automatically.
Review your Row-Level Security (RLS) rules that rely on auth.uid(). That’s the same function used for email or OAuth logins in Supabase, so it should just work as-is.
Purpose/Result:
Makes sure a user who logs in with Google is recognized in your “profiles” table, the same way an email-based user is.
Maintains consistent permissions—no weird scenarios where an OAuth user can’t access something because your RLS logic forgot about them.
Testing Approach:
Look in your “profiles” table after an OAuth sign-in. If you see a new row with the user’s ID, it’s probably good.
If your RLS depends on certain roles or membership checks, confirm an OAuth user can perform the allowed actions.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
The rest of your app interacts with the user exactly as it does with email-registered users, with no special treatment needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 6: STAY MODULAR FOR FUTURE PROVIDERS
What You Do:
Keep the loginWithProvider approach consistent.
If you add, say, Microsoft OAuth, you just do loginWithProvider("azure") or whatever Supabase’s parameter is, then pop a new button labeled “Sign in with Microsoft.”
No duplication of your entire logic chain.
Purpose/Result:
A simple pattern for scaling up.
If your project manager wants you to add “Sign in with Apple,” it’s just toggling in Supabase and adding a button.
Testing Approach:
Ensure each new provider also has a valid redirect and no mismatches in the application’s callback URL.
Usually, you just quickly try it out yourself to confirm you land properly in your callback.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
One method in your store or hook, multiple UI triggers, and minimal extra complexity each time you adopt a new provider.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 7: TEST & VALIDATE ALL FLOWS
What You Do:
End-to-end testing: chain the entire login process, from button press to provider authentication to your callback to accessing restricted pages.
Check for special cases where the user denies permission at the OAuth stage or closes the window halfway.
Purpose/Result:
Confirms that your entire system is robust against user cancellations, connectivity blips, and unexpected states (like already being logged in).
Testing Approach:
Incognito sessions are your friend.
Try multiple providers, add them to your staging environment, see if all them direct you properly.
Watch your logs for any “invalid grant” or “bad request” errors, which often signal a mismatch in configuration.
What a Working Setup Feels Like:
If you can sign up via Google, sign out, sign in again via GitHub, sign out, sign in via basic email/password… and everything just works, you know you’ve got a well-oiled machine.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IN SHORT
By combining these steps, you have a solid, modular OAuth integration using Supabase. You’ll toggle providers in the Supabase dashboard, rely on a single loginWithProvider function in your code, and share the same callback route to finalize authentication for both email and OAuth. Adding more providers in the future? No problem—point them at the same flow, so your system remains elegantly consistent.
