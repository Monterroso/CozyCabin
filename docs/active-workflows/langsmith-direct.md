1. Ensure Environment Variables Are Set Up Correctly
Make sure your Deno environment or Supabase Edge Function config includes these variables (or equivalents):
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY
LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT (if you’re using self-hosted LangSmith) or LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 / LANGCHAIN_PROJECT (if you’re using the hosted version).
OPENAI_API_KEY
Confirm these variables are actually present in your function environment (for example, using Deno.env.get("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY")).
---
2. Create or Identify a Single Entry Function
Decide which function is the single entry point for your requests, typically “handleAdminAgentRequest” in agentOrchestrator.ts.
This function should:
Accept the user’s messages or input.
Use tools (summarizeTickets, categorizeTicket, etc.) to handle the logic.
Return the final AI response.
---
3. Wrap That Function with a Single “Traceable” or “withLangSmithTracing” Decorator
Include your custom or LangChain-provided tracing logic:
For example, a “withLangSmithTracing” higher-order function that:
Creates a new “run” at the start.
Invokes your function.
Ends the run (in a finally block) whether you return or throw.
The goal is to produce exactly one run in LangSmith for each user request, capturing any sub-calls in that single run.
---
4. Pass an Instrumented (Traced) ChatOpenAI Instance to Tools
Instead of creating ChatOpenAI in each tool file, create a single ChatOpenAI instance in your orchestrator (or a shared context). For example:
In agentOrchestrator.ts:
• import { ChatOpenAI } from "langchain/chat_models/openai";
• import { tracer } from "../shared/langsmith.ts";
• const chatModel = new ChatOpenAI({ openAIApiKey: ..., callbacks: [tracer] });
Pass that instance to summarizeTickets, categorizeTicket, etc. so they all use the same ChatOpenAI object.
Summarize example: summarizeTickets(tickets, chatModel)
---
5. Refactor Tool Functions to Accept chatModel as a Parameter
Update function signatures. For example, in summarizeTickets.ts:
   export async function summarizeTickets(
     tickets: Ticket[],
     chatModel: ChatOpenAI
   ): Promise<string> { ... }
Remove any direct references to ChatOpenAI inside the tool function.
This ensures each tool call logs to LangSmith as part of the same run, rather than creating multiple distinct runs or missing the run altogether.
---
6. Validate That Each ChatOpenAI Call Actually Triggers a Sub-Run
With each invocation, you should see a separate “LLM call” in the LangSmith dashboard inside your main run.
If your code spawns sub-chains or sub-agents, pass the same tracer to them, or ensure that they automatically inherit from the main run context.
---
7. Confirm That the Run Ends Properly
If you have a custom tracing wrapper (like “withLangSmithTracing”), put a try/finally block around the user function:
   async function withLangSmithTracing(func: Function) {
     const run = await tracer.startRun(...); // if you do manual runs
     try {
       const result = await func();
       // Possibly set run status to success
       return result;
     } catch (error) {
       // Possibly set run status to error
       throw error;
     } finally {
       await tracer.endRun(run.id);
     }
   }
If you rely only on “callbacks: [tracer],” then each ChatOpenAI call logs as a separate LLM run. You might still want a single parent run to group them, so consider either using LangChain’s built-in chain constructs or a custom approach for parent-child runs.
---
8. Test with a Single Request Flow
Deploy or run the Edge Function locally.
Send a single request to your “adminAgent” endpoint:
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"newUserMessage":"Can you summarize our unassigned tickets?"}' \
     https://<YOUR_SUPABASE_FUNCTION_URL>/adminAgent
Check LangSmith to see if you have:
A single run with a label like “handleAdminAgentRequest.”
That run containing sub-calls for your LLM usage (summarizeTickets, etc.).
---
9. Monitor for Multiple Requests and Edge Cases
Verify concurrent requests each produce distinct runs in LangSmith.
If any calls remain incomplete or partially logged, ensure your wrap logic and environment variables are correct.
If needed, add console logs or debug statements to verify the tracer is being passed throughout.
---
10. Consider Upgrading to an Agent/Chain
If you’re comfortable with a chain-based approach, you can create a single “agent” in LangChain that uses Tools for summarizing, categorizing, and updating tickets.
This agent can automatically handle sub-run creation for each tool call.
Example:
     const agent = initializeAgent(tools, chatModel, { callbacks: [tracer], ... });
     const result = await agent.run("Summarize all open tickets");
Everything gets automatically grouped in one chain run, with each tool call as a sub-run.
---
11. Maintain Clean Environment Variable Usage
Keep your secrets in your environment (.env or Supabase config).
Never store them in code or commit them to source control.
Confirm that all references (e.g., Deno.env.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")) are in the correct place.
---
By following these steps, you’ll have a more direct approach, closely mirroring the Python example where a single function is fully traced, returning a single run in LangSmith that encapsulates each LLM call. This ensures clarity, a one-to-one relationship between requests and runs, and more immediate or intuitive debugging in your LangSmith dashboard.
