# Phase 4: Advanced Agent Dashboard Features

Building out collaboration tools and improved agent workflows as described in:
- @project-overview.md
- @user-flow.md 
- @tech-stack-rules.md
- @ui-rules.md

## Features & Tasks

1. Real-Time Updates & Collaboration  
   - [Frontend] Integrate Supabase real-time subscriptions to push updates when tickets change status or get new notes.  
   - [Frontend] Render in-app notifications for ticket updates (e.g., "Ticket #123 updated").  
   - [Backend] Set up Supabase channels for ticket changes, ensuring minimal overhead (subscribe only to relevant data).  
   - [Backend] Handle real-time presence data (optional) for indicating agent availability.

2. Bulk Operations & Filtering  
   - [Frontend] Allow agents to select multiple tickets for bulk status updates or assignments.  
   - [Frontend] Add advanced filtering (e.g., by tag, priority, date range).  
   - [Backend] Extend existing queries or create new endpoints for multi-update requests.  
   - [Backend] Include validations to ensure only authorized agents can bulk update.

3. Internal Notes & Attachments  
   - [Frontend] Enhance ticket detail view with an internal notes section that only agents can see.  
   - [Frontend] Implement file attachments within notes (via Supabase Storage).  
   - [Backend] Create new columns or tables to store internal notes, attachments metadata.  
   - [Backend] Validate file types and size constraints, referencing security rules in @tech-stack-rules.md.

4. Performance & Memoization  
   - [Frontend] Optimize re-renders with React.memo or useMemo (document reason as per @tech-stack-rules.md).  
   - [Frontend] Potentially lazy load large components (ticket detail forms).  
   - [Backend] Review subscription footprints, ensuring queries remain performant (indexes, well-structured DB tables).

5. Testing & QA  
   - [Frontend] Write unit tests for bulk updates, real-time subscription updates, internal notes.  
   - [Backend] Confirm RLS policies still hold for collaborative features (no unauthorized access to notes).  
   - [Frontend + Backend] Perform integration tests ensuring attachments are uploaded and tied to the correct ticket.
