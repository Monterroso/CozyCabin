## Features & Tasks

1. Testing Expansion & Stabilization  
   - [Frontend] Add integration/E2E test coverage (possibly introducing Cypress at this stage).  
   - [Frontend] Refine unit tests for new features (bulk updates, AI suggestions, routing rules).  
   - [Backend] Conduct load tests on Supabase queries (particularly ticket creation and AI usage).  
   - [Backend] Validate RLS and role-based logic thoroughly, ensuring no security oversights.

2. Performance Audit  
   - [Frontend] Check Core Web Vitals in development and staging builds.  
   - [Frontend] Evaluate code splitting, lazy loading, and potential optimizations.  
   - [Backend] Monitor Supabase DB performance (index usage, potential slow queries).  
   - [Backend] Evaluate AWS Amplify build times, Lambda cold starts, and caching strategies.

3. Final Deployment Checklist  
   - [Frontend] Confirm environment variables remain secure; no .env keys or secrets in code.  
   - [Frontend] Execute a final production build, verifying the UI, theming, and responsiveness.  
   - [Backend] Ensure that Supabase is configured for production (proper RLS, backups, etc.).  
   - [Backend] Finalize AWS Amplify settings (custom domain, SSL certs, environment variables).

4. Documentation & Handoff  
   - [Frontend] Update any final changes in docs (README, codebase architecture, usage instructions).  
   - [Backend] Produce or update an Admin Guide for Supabase setup, migrations, and environment configuration.  
   - [Frontend + Backend] Confirm that user flows described in @user-flow.md match final UI (quick self-audit).

5. Production Go-Live & Monitoring  
   - [Frontend] Switch the production branch to the final version, enabling AWS Amplify auto-deploy.  
   - [Backend] Monitor logging and Sentry alerts post-launch, addressing any critical issues.  
   - [Frontend + Backend] Initialize ongoing maintenance plan (error triage, AI cost monitoring, user feedback, etc.).
