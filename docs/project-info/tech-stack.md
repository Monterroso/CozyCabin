## Why These Choices?

### Development Speed & Quality
- TypeScript + React combination ensures rapid development while maintaining code quality
- Shadcn + Tailwind CSS enables quick UI development with consistent design
- Supabase reduces backend development time significantly

### Testing Strategy
- Initially focusing only on Jest for critical path testing
- Reasons for postponing Cypress:
    - Faster initial development cycle
    - Focus on core functionality first
    - Reduced setup and maintenance overhead
    - Can be added in week 2 after core features are stable
    - Jest provides sufficient coverage for MVP

### State Management & Form Handling
- Zustand provides predictable state management without Redux complexity
- React Hook Form + Zod ensures type-safe, performant form handling
- Reduced boilerplate and improved developer experience

### Scalability & Performance
- Supabase handles database scaling
- AWS Amplify provides production-grade hosting
- AWS Lambda enables efficient serverless processing
- Tailwind's purge feature ensures minimal CSS bundle size

### File Storage & Serverless
- Supabase Storage provides simple, secure file management
- AWS Lambda handles compute-intensive tasks efficiently
- Cost-effective scaling for both storage and processing

### Maintenance & Cost
- Managed services reduce operational overhead
- Supabase and AWS Amplify have generous free tiers
- Stack choices minimize the need for DevOps expertise

### Monitoring & Error Tracking
- Sentry provides immediate visibility into production issues
- Minimal setup overhead for basic error tracking
- Can expand monitoring capabilities in week 2
- Free tier sufficient for initial launch
- Critical for maintaining production reliability

### AI Implementation
- OpenAI API enables all planned AI features
- Good documentation and TypeScript support
- Scalable pricing based on usage
- AWS Lambda for efficient AI processing

## Not Included & Why

### Docker
- Not needed as we're using managed services
- Would add unnecessary complexity
- AWS Amplify handles deployment concerns
- Can be added later if specific containerization needs arise

### Monitoring Tools (Datadog/New Relic)
- Overkill for initial project scope
- Sentry provides sufficient error tracking and monitoring
- Built-in AWS Amplify and Supabase monitoring complement Sentry

## Future Considerations

- **Cypress**: Add in week 2 for comprehensive E2E testing
- **Advanced Search**: Can implement Typesense/Meilisearch when needed
- **Caching Layer**: Redis can be added if response caching needs optimization
