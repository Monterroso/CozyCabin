# Streamlining Wrappers and Simplifying Observability

Below are some recommended steps for removing extra wrappers (like `withLangSmithTracing`, `withAiLogging`, etc.) and reducing complexity in your application's code.

---

## 1. Centralize the Run Creation

1. **Create One Run per Request**  
   Rather than wrapping each function individually, instantiate your LangSmith run only once per incoming request or chain of operations.  

   - Example of a single-run approach:  
     ```typescript:path/to/yourSingleRunFunction.ts
     export async function executeMainFlow() {
       const run = await client.createRun({ 
         name: "main_flow_run", 
         project_name: "cozycabin",
         run_type: "chain" 
       });
       try {
         // Do normal operations here
         // ...
       } catch (err) {
         // Handle errors
         // ...
         throw err;
       } finally {
         // End or finalize the run once everything is done
         await run.end();
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Pass the Run Down**  
   If you need to track sub-steps, simply pass the run information into deeper utility functions or callbacks.

## 2. Refactor Shared Logic into a Single Utility

If you have multiple wrappers (`withLangSmithTracing`, `withAiLogging`, etc.), combine their functionality into one utility. This main utility can:

- Initialize and end runs.  
- Attach or handle logging.  
- Catch errors and finalize the run appropriately.

That way, you only maintain one centralized flow.

---

## 3. Convert Nested Wrappers to Straightforward Async Flows

Complex nesting (multiple calls to different wrappers) can lead to multiple open runs, each waiting on different promises. Instead:

1. **Flatten** the flow into a single async function that does the following:
   - Start the run.  
   - Await all async operations (like your model calls or database queries).  
   - End the run (or let it automatically end) after the operations complete.

2. **Await Everything**.  
   - Make sure any sub-call is properly awaited so your central "initiate run → do tasks → finalize run" flow knows when it's truly safe to close.

## 4. Adopt Built-In LangChain Callbacks

To streamline, consider using LangChain's built-in callback system:

1. **Attach tracers directly** to your `ChatModel` or chain.  
2. **Eliminate extra "startRun / endRun" code** where possible, leaning on the library's hooks and callbacks.  

If extra data or custom logging is needed, write a custom callback handler that integrates with your single-run approach.

---

## 5. Ensure Error Paths Are Propagated

1. **Don't Swallow Errors**.  
   - Either re-throw errors or ensure every exception feeds into a final `.end()` call.  

2. **Simplify Catch Blocks**.  
   - In your main run function's catch block, finalize the run or re-throw.  
   - Avoid partial handling that can block the code from signaling "I'm done" to LangSmith.

## 6. Document Your Architecture

Finally, update your docs to include:

- **A High-Level Diagram** of how logs are created and ended.  
- **Guidance** for new team members on how to add new functionality without introducing nested wrappers or multiple runs in parallel.  

This ensures everyone writes code that's consistent with your new single-run approach.

By following these steps, you'll reduce nesting, simplify your asynchronous flow, and prevent lingering runs in LangSmith.
